<h3>What is a PID controller?</h3>
<p>PID stands for Proportional-Integral-Derivative. This is a type of feedback controller whose output,
a control variable (CV), is generally based on the error between some user-defined set point
(SP) and some measured process variable (PV). Each element of the PID controller refers to a
particular action taken on the error:<br>
<br>
Proportional:
Error multiplied by a gain, Kp. This is an adjustable amplifier. In many systems Kp is
responsible for process stability: too low and the PV can drift away; too high and the
PV can oscillate.<br>
<br>
Integral:
The integral of error multiplied by a gain, Ki. In many systems Ki is responsible for
driving error to zero, but to set Ki too high is to invite oscillation or instability or
integrator windup or actuator saturation.<br>
<br>
Derivative:
The rate of change of error multiplied by a gain, Kd. In many systems Kd is responsible
for system response: too low and the PV will oscillate; too high and the PV will respond
sluggishly. The designer should also note that derivative action amplifies any noise in
the error signal.<br>
<br>
Tuning of a PID involves the adjustment of Kp, Ki, and Kd to achieve some user-defined
"optimal" character of system response. <br>
<br>
Although many architectures exist for control systems, the PID controller is mature and
well-understood by practitioners. For these reasons, it is often the first choice for new
controller design. It satisfies Occam's Razor in being the simplest solution for most cases.<br>
